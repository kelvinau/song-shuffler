# Song Shuffler
Simple PowerShell Script to Shuffle Songs by Adding a Random Number

Some cars cannot shuffle or repeat playing the shuffled songs even though the rest are never played. 
This is a simple script to add random number at the beginning, so that they can be played normally in a shuffled order.

Run `powershell ./shuffler.ps1` and the items in `song` will be shuffled.
